#WARNING: EXPIREMENTAL! ROOT REQUIRED! MAY NOT BE SAFE! USE WITH CAUTION
#YOU ARE RESPOSIBLE AFTER ROOTING YOUR DEVICE AND PLAYING WITH STUFF LIKE THIS!


#No cats were harmed while putting this together, or as a result of my own personal use.


#Should be safe, keep it in /data/local if your not sure. I use /vendor/usr/bin personally for persistence. Message me, I'll help best I can. This began on a moto e5 play lineageOS(8.1) and finished on moto g7 power lineageOS(9) pay attention for where your devices hostapd.conf shows up(start your hotspot). Usually /data/vendor/wifi or /data/misc/wifi use the existing hostapd.conf as an example, this will be device specific. Works on both Oreo and Pie for me with slight variations between. This uses /data/vendor/wifi if hour running oreo change this at the biginning of script.
